# Parametric and input sensitivity and uncertainty analysis with Sensitivity Analysis Library (SALib)

[SALib](https://github.com/SALib/SALib) is a collection of Python implementations of commonly used sensitivity analysis methods. Useful in systems modeling to calculate the effects of model inputs or exogenous factors on outputs of interest.

The `salib` module in ReEmission provides additional functionality including support for multiple parameter probability density functions, multi-scenario sensitivity analysis, dynamic access to configuration parameters and inputs in Re-Emission, and several visualization options.
